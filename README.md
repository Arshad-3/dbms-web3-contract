# DBMS Web3 Contract

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for the DBMS project, which aims to tokenize physical assets. The project leverages blockchain technology to provide enhanced liquidity, transparency, and accessibility for asset management.

## Project Overview

The tokenization of physical assets promises to revolutionize asset management, offering enhanced liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. However, existing solutions face several challenges. Traditional asset markets often restrict accessibility due to high entry barriers, limiting participation to a select few. Moreover, opacity in asset ownership and transaction records introduces inefficiencies and fraud risks. Managing diverse portfolios of physical assets entails cumbersome processes, including ownership transfer and transaction settlement, often requiring intermediaries and incurring additional costs.

This project aims to overcome these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for asset tokenization. Through a user-friendly interface, it democratizes access to asset tokenization, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in fractional ownership of physical assets. Transparent and immutable records of asset ownership and transactions are ensured through smart contracts, mitigating fraud risks and fostering trust among participants. By streamlining asset management processes, our project reduces reliance on intermediaries and simplifies tasks such as ownership transfer and dividend distribution.

In conclusion, our project strives to empower investors by offering a user-centric approach to asset tokenization, fostering financial inclusivity and opportunity. With its emphasis on accessibility, transparency, and efficiency, it seeks to unlock the full potential of asset tokenization, ushering in a new era of asset management.

## Smart Contracts

The repository includes the following smart contracts:

1. **assetToken.sol**: This contract defines the token representing the physical asset.
2. **tokenOfAsset.sol**: This contract manages the fractional ownership and transfer of the asset tokens.
